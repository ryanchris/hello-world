# hello-world
So this is my first time using GitHub.

I think I have a little bit of apprehension about using this tool, but I think there's a lot of power in the way developers use Git â€” and a lot of opportunity for designers and product managers in using the tool to disseminate their work. I'm looking for good examples of how design artifacts are being shared here, so point me towards them if you know where they're at!
